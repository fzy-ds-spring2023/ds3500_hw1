###Museum of Contempory Art Chicago Sankey Analysis
_Felix Yang - ds3500_

When I take a look at the various Sankey diagrams, there is a strong representation of the more major large countries. We can see that American artists dominate the museum's art gallery, but we can also see how other European countries such as Germany, France, Britain, and Italian do have major representation. European and American art are heavily biased in the art world throughout the years, but especially in the earlier decades.

In addition, we can take a look towards the gender splits of the art. We can see that female representation is much lower than that of males. Now this could be due to various traditional gender roles as we see that earlier decades have barely any female artists and among nationalities females artists are mainly from European and American backgrounds.

As this data consists of the art that the museum contains, a likely reason for the distribution of such nationalities, gender, and decades are likely due to the availability of art from such backgrounds. There is probably more art from American and European backgrounds and from men as well. However, this does not mean that the other pieces of art are less important or necessary. Perhaps the museum should also strive to obtain art from lesser represented countries to be more inclusive of such a diverse art world.
